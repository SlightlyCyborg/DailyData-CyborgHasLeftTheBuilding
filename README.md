# DailyData-CyborgHasLeftTheBuilding

This app is theoretically simple. I will use a headless browser to visit my routers gateway. I will log in using the creds found in .creds (which will be .gitignore(ed) ). I will then search for my androids mac address in the connected users. If it has a div of the class off, then I will log that I am off the network. Otherwise I am on the network.
